## History

  Prior names include: `textiled` by Yulian Kuncheff, `jstextile` by Christian Perfect. 
  Both of these versions include bugs, bad coding habits and slight issues, not to knock them as without them this wouldn't exist. 
  
  With nothing in my pockets, I developed this version while sitting at Mashape offices, and some at a small quaint cafe named South Beach Cafe; 
  Fueled by expresso and motivated by a nice little band accidentally stumbled upon through spotify called Delta Spirit
